1. Given five positive integers, 
2. find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 
    - I think , i need to exclude the largest number in the list to be excluded and sum the reminaining to get the smallest.
    - Similarly, need to exclude the smallest among the array to be excluded and sum to get the greatest.
    > It is Actually interesting.  
3. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
